# DEUM.


### Welcome to DEUM. The fight is about to begin.

DEUM is a fully in-Discord turn based PVP game. It features 4 different characters, each with 4 unique abilities.


### How to play
Everyone plays on the same map. The concept is simple: Fight in DEUM until there is no one to fight anymore.

Players earn upgrades by traversing the map. Upgrades can be used to upgrade the amount of distance you can move, the amount of damage you do and they can be used to upgrade your character's abilities.

Combat initiates when two players are adjacent to each other and a player decides to attack.


# The Characters
Each of the characters in DEUM feature completely unique play styles and abilities.
### SOBEK

Sobek is a strong early game character. He BLEEDs his enemies, and can chase them relentlessly using his Dash. However, if he picks a fight he's not ready for.. He will have no way to escape.

The well known Ra is a strong late game character. He mainly gains power by picking up his Sun Orbs that spawn around him. With each Sun Orb, Ra gets exponentially more powerful, until finally unlocking his ultimate. A late game Ra is almost impossible to defeat, so it is very easy to stop him during the early game.

Horus is the emperor of the sands. while he is less mobile than other characters, he can use his soldiers to create a wall of defense. if you want to stop him, overwhelm him, he cant win without his soldiers! strong late game and bad early game
